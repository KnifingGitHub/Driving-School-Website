    review: "I had a very satisfying, fruitful experience when I took driving lessons from Edward. He is a patient and knowledgeable driving Instructor. He goes to great lengths to explain the safe driving standards expected during the test. He carries a portable small whiteboard and magnetic car models with him, by which he explains the driving maneuvers that form part of the test. He is also familiar with many of the routes chosen by the examiners, makes the student practice on such routes, which is very helpful while taking the actual test. He also has clean, safe vehicles to teach driving. Having had magnificent reviews from his students, Edward remains very busy, so it is recommended to set up appointments with him at an early date. Thanks Edwards and wish you the very best.",

    review: "My experience with my instructor Edward was excellent. Being new to BC and being rusty because I had not been driving for a while, I was able to pass my class 5 road test on my first attempt in 3 weeks. Thanks to Edward I was able to erase the bad habits I had acquired during my time driving outside of Canada. He is really clear with all his explanations (sometimes he'll even clarify ideas using his whiteboard) and is great calling you out when you're not making things in the right way. Additionally, he was really flexible when it came to scheduling lessons and the rental for the road test. The reviews already speak for themselves but I will strongly recommend Edward as an instructor to anyone.",

They were always willing to answer my questions and provided me with helpful advice that made me feel more confident behind the wheel. I appreciated Edwards attention to detail and their ability to break down complex concepts into easy-to-understand terms. They were always positive and encouraging, which made the learning experience enjoyable and stress free. I never felt rushed or pressured during our lessons, and Edward always took the time to ensure that I understood each concept before moving on to the next. Overall, I would highly recommend taking these lessons to anyone looking to improve their driving skills. Edward’s professionalism, patience, and commitment to helping his students succeed makes an excellent choice for anyone looking to pass their road test.",

They are very good in giving confidence and have a good idea of the routes around the test centers in Richmond. I enrolled with them for my class 5 license and passed.",

    review: "I must say I am extremely satisfied getting Edward as my driving instructor. I am new to Canada, arriving beginning of June 2023 from Singapore where we practice right-hand driving, with different rules and regulations, above all, there is no such thing as right turn on red! To find the right instructor, I Google and spend a few days reading customer reviews and comments before I finally approached Edward. Edward has been extremely patient in helping me to unlearn my old practice, explain the rationale behind the rules, road sign and regulations, above all, help me to adapt to safe driving in B.C. I am very impressed with his professionalism and his concern in making sure that I master “Safe Driving”, not only for passing the test, as he keeps on reminding that I have to maintain the Safe Driving Culture to ensure safety for all. I passed my class 5 road test on my first attempt within two months under Edward’s guidance and training. I would strongly recommend Edward and 604 Driving School Ltd to all potential drivers as my own experience and results is the best proof. Once again, thank you Edward.",

    review: "After taking some classes at 604 Driving School. I passed my class 5 road test on the first attempt. As a new Canadian driver, I was worried about finding a good professional driving school because you are making an important investment. I can not feel more satisfied with their professional service. Edward is a patient instructor whit the ability to explain to you easily (even in your mother language, Spanish in my case) you feel safe all the time and learn from the first moment. Their training cars are very clean and very well maintained, you feel that when are driving. Instructor adapts their schedules to our necessities. I couldn't find that level of service in other schools. Edward had been following my process from my first class until taking the road test, even when I was in the ICBC office I noticed that the evaluators know him because his students always are very well trained. That gives you confidence. Of course, I highly recommended this driving school and taking classes with Edward, so if you are a person who cares about safety and getting a professional service you are in the right place. Thank you so much, Edward!",

Before my test I had some road experience and thought I was ready for the test, I wanted to make sure I passed first time and so I got some lessons from Gina. As much practice as I had it didn’t compare to the knowledge that she was able to teach me. There are so many safety aspects and important things to know for a driving test that only someone like Gina can teach you. Today I passed my test on my first attempt and I can say with certainty that I wouldn’t have been able to do it without her! I would highly recommend 604 driving school to anyone taking a test, for me it was the difference between passing and failing. Thank you again for everything! :)",

    review: "In preparation for my Class 5L resit, I had lessons with Edward of 604 Driving School, who was phenomenal. He immediately put me at ease, was excellent in picking up and correcting my driving mistakes. He also made sure the lesson route covered the busiest intersections and highways within Richmond Lansdowne area, which was useful as I had booked my road test at ICBC Richmond Lansdowne.",

Everything went smoothly for me, from the enrollment process to their driving lessons and passing my class 5 road test. I salute my instructor, Gina, for helping me improve my driving skills aligned with ICBC driving standards. She’s very knowledgeable and easy to work with, which will boost your confidence. Thank you, Gina, and more power to 604 Driving School!",

    review: "Excellent customer service! I failed the first road test but Edward didn’t give up and asked what has happened because in his opinion there were margins to appeal. Eventually we did not appeal, but I appreciated he was willing to go the extra mile, and against his own interest (failed test = another attempt = more money). Thank you Edward!",
